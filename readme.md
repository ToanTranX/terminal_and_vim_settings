# My Terminal Files

This is a snapshot of four important, terminal-related configuration files of mine. This is their state of Septemeber 7th, 2014, admittedly one of my first full days using Vim. So the .vimrc file will most likely change if I keep using the program.  

.bash_profile and .vimrc go into ~/

mustard.vim goes into ~/.vim/colors/

sts_sep_2014.terminal can be imported as a profile in your Terminal
