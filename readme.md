# A Back-up of My Terminal Files

This is a snapshot of four of my terminal-related configuration files. This is their state of Septemeber 7th, 2014, admittedly one of my first full days using Vim. So the .vimrc file will most likely change if I keep using the program.  

### To Use

1. Rename 'bash_profile' and 'vimrc' as '.bash_profile' and '.vimrc', respectively. I removed the dot when pushing to github to make moving files easier. 
2. Place .bash_profile and .vimrc into ~/

3. Place mustard.vim into ~/.vim/colors/ (which you may have to mkdir yourself)

4. sts_sep_2014.terminal can be imported as a profile in your Terminal application for OS X.
