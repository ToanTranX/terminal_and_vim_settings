# A Back-up of My Terminal and Text Editor Setup Files

This is a snapshot of my terminal and Vim-related configuration files. 

## To Use

### Bash Profile
Rename `bash_profile` to `.bash_profile` and place it into `~/`. If no `~/.bash_profile` exists in your system yet, you can do this with `curl -o ~/.bash_profile https://github.com/sts10/terminal_and_vim_settings/blob/master/bash_profile` or, from inside this cloned repo: `cp bash_profile ~/.bash_profile`. Restart your terminal for changes to take effect.

### Vim Setup
Consider installing MacVim or Neovim before starting this section. See section below.

1. Rename `vimrc` as `.vimrc` and place it in `~/`. If you're cool replacing any existing `~/.vimrc`, you can do this from the command line by running `curl -o ~/.vimrc https://github.com/sts10/terminal_and_vim_settings/blob/master/vimrc`, or cloning this directory and running `cp vimrc ~/.vimrc` from inside this repo's directory.
2. `mkdir` the following directories: `~/.vim`, `~/.vim/backup`, `~/.vim/swap`, `~/.vim/undo`
3. We'll now install [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) and our plugins. This should happen automatically when you load vim for the first time. If that fails, visit [the vim-plug readme](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) for installation instructions, then run `:PlugInstall` in a Vim buffer. 
4. `mustard.vim` is a Vim colorscheme I made to mirror my preferred [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) theme, [Mustard](http://colorsublime.com/theme/Mustard). I have [sts10/vim-mustard.vim](https://github.com/sts10/vim-mustard) listed as a plugin in this `vimrc`, so the colorscheme should install when you run `:PlugInstall`. But if it doesn't, place `mustard.vim` into `~/.vim/colors/` (which you may have to `mkdir` yourself). Then either run `:colorscheme mustard` and then `set background=dark` or put those two commands into your `.vimrc` (they're already in the `vimrc` file in this repo).

### Flavors of Vim
- Installing MacVim: [Link to latest MacVim snapshots from the macvim-dev fork](https://github.com/macvim-dev/macvim/releases/). Once installed, you're going to want to setup the command line `mvim` command (should be included in the download) by putting the `mvim` file in place-- you can do this by running `cp mvim /usr/local/bin/`. For help, here's a [helpful blog post](http://michaellee.co/launch-macvim-from-terminal/) and [my blog post on making the switch](http://sts10.github.io/blog/2015/08/07/from-terminal-vim-to-mac-vim/).
- Installing NeoVim: [Instructions for installing NeoVim with Homebrew](https://github.com/neovim/homebrew-neovim/blob/master/README.md) plus [my blog post on NeoVim](http://sts10.github.io/blog/2015/08/11/neovim-an-open-source-project/). Homebrew [lives here](http://brew.sh/). Neovim's ["Following HEAD" page lives here](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Following-HEAD). 
To symlink your normal Vim configuration for NeoVim to use, run `ln -s ~/.vim ~/.config/nvim` and `ln -s ~/.vimrc ~/.config/nvim/init.vim` after installation.
- Installing the latest version of Vim: We're going to use Homebrew, but since we prefer vim-plug, here's how we've got to do this. If you already have [RVM](https://rvm.io/) installed, first run `rvm use system`, then run `brew install vim`, then return to your preferred version of Ruby for RVM. You shouldn't need any special alias in your `bash_profile` to use this new version of Vim. If that doesn't work smoothly, here's a [helpful blog post](http://www.prioritized.net/blog/upgrading-vim-on-os-x/) on how to update your command line Vim using Homebrew. (Hint: `which vim` tells you where your `vim` lives.)

### Coding Font

My go-to coding font is [Deja Vu Sans Mono](http://dejavu-fonts.org/wiki/Download). [More info on my colors/font setup](http://sts10.github.io/blog/2014/02/14/my-current-coding-setup/).

### Terminal Colors

`sam_terminal_2015.terminal` can be imported as a profile in your Terminal application for OS X. Alternatively you could try importing `sam_2015_iterm.itermcolors` into Terminal or iTerm2 (as of November 2015 I'd recommend the [Nightly version](http://iterm2.com/downloads/nightly/#/section/home) so you can get [Neovim true color support](http://sts10.github.io/blog/2015/10/24/true-hex-colors-with-neovim-and-iterm2/)). As a last resort, examine the included screenshot to get my preferred Terminal colors. You could also just import some version of [Solarized Light Terminal profile](https://github.com/tomislav/osx-terminal.app-colors-solarized). 

### Sublime Text

I've also included two files related to my [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) setup (though most preferences will carry over to [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3)). The two files are my user_preferences and my keybindings. My preferred Sublime theme is [Mustard](http://colorsublime.com/theme/Mustard). For spell check and other settings specific to Markdown files, you'll need to write those settings yourself in the appropriate file location. The only major package you might want is "Expand Selection to Quotes".
