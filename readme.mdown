# A Back-up of My Terminal Files

This is a snapshot of four of my terminal-related configuration files. This is their state of Septemeber 7th, 2014, admittedly one of my first full days using Vim. So the .vimrc file will most likely change if I keep using the program.  

## To Use

### Bash Profile
Rename `bash_profile` to `.bash_profile` and place it into `~/`. If no `~/.bash_profile` exists in your system yet, you can do this with `cp bash_profile ~/.bash_profile`


### Vim Setup
1. Rename `vimrc` as `.vimrc` and place it in `~/`. If no `~/.vimrc` file exists, you can do this with `cp vimrc ~/.vimrc`
2. `mkdir` the following directories: `~/.vim`, `~/.vim/backup`, `~/.vim/swap`, `~/.vim/undo`
3. Go install [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim).
4. In an open Vim window, run `:PluginInstall`
5. `mustard.vim` is a Vim colorscheme I made to mirror my preferred Sublime Text theme, [Mustard](http://colorsublime.com/theme/Mustard). To use, place `mustard.vim` into `~/.vim/colors/` (which you may have to mkdir yourself). Then either run `:colorscheme mustard` then `set background=dark` or put those two commands into your .vimrc (they're already in the `vimrc` file in this repo).
6. Installing MacVim: [Readme with link to latest MacVim snapshot](https://github.com/macvim-dev/macvim/releases/). Once installed, you're going to want to setup the command line `mvim` command by putting the `mvim` file in place by using `cp mvim /usr/local/bin/`. For help, here's a [helpful blog post](http://michaellee.co/launch-macvim-from-terminal/) and [my blog post on making the switch](http://sts10.github.io/blog/2015/08/07/from-terminal-vim-to-mac-vim/)). 
7. Installing NeoVim: [Instructions on installing NeoVim with Homebrew](https://github.com/neovim/homebrew-neovim/blob/master/README.md) plus [my blog post on NeoVim](http://sts10.github.io/blog/2015/08/11/neovim-an-open-source-project/). Homebrew [lives here](http://brew.sh/). To symlink your normal Vim configuration for NeoVim to use, run `ln -s ~/.vimrc ~/.nvimrc` and `ln -s ~/.vim ~/.nvim` after installation.

If you need, here's a [helpful blog post](http://www.prioritized.net/blog/upgrading-vim-on-os-x/) on how to update your command line Vim using Homebrew. Hint: `which vim` tells you where your `vim` lives.

### Font

My go-to coding font is [Deja Vu Sans Mono](http://dejavu-fonts.org/wiki/Download). [More on my setup](http://sts10.github.io/blog/2014/02/14/my-current-coding-setup/).

### Terminal Colors

`sam_terminal_2015.terminal` can be imported as a profile in your Terminal application for OS X. Alternatively you could try imported `sam_2015_iterm.itermcolors` into Terminal or Iterm2. As a last resort, examine the screenshot to get my preferred Terminal colors. Can also just import some sort of [Solarized Light Terminal profile](https://github.com/tomislav/osx-terminal.app-colors-solarized). 

### Sublime Text

I've also included two files related to My Sublime Text 2 setup (though most preferences will carry over to Sublime Text 3). The two files are my user_preferences and my keybindings. My preferred Sublime theme is [Mustard](http://colorsublime.com/theme/Mustard).
